# Walmart Department Clustering Analysis Using K-Means

## Project Overview
K-means clustering analysis of Walmart department sales performance using 421,570+ sales records from ALY6040 Data Mining Applications course. This project segments departments into distinct performance tiers based on sales behavior patterns to support strategic retail decision-making and inventory optimization.

## Business Objective
Identify natural department groupings based on sales behavior to enable targeted strategies for inventory management, promotional planning, and performance benchmarking across Walmart's retail operations.

## Key Results
- **Segmented 81 departments** into 3 distinct performance clusters
- **Achieved 0.64 average silhouette score** indicating strong cluster quality
- **Identified three behavioral patterns**: Promotional-Driven, Necessity-Driven, and Specialty departments
- **Delivered actionable insights** for differentiated retail strategies

## Department Clusters Identified

### Cluster 1: Promotional-Driven Departments
- **Characteristics**: High holiday sensitivity, high volatility
- **Examples**: Toys, Electronics, Seasonal items
- **Strategy**: Dynamic inventory management, aggressive promotional calendars

### Cluster 2: Necessity-Driven Departments  
- **Characteristics**: Stable demand, lower volatility
- **Examples**: Grocery, Household essentials
- **Strategy**: Consistent inventory levels, everyday low pricing

### Cluster 3: Specialty Departments
- **Characteristics**: Unique behavior patterns, moderate performance
- **Examples**: Jewelry, Pharmacy, specialized categories
- **Strategy**: Targeted marketing, specialized staff training

## Technical Implementation
- **Algorithm**: K-means clustering with k=3 centers
- **Programming**: R with tidyverse, cluster packages
- **Features**: Average weekly sales, holiday sales ratio, sales volatility
- **Validation**: Silhouette analysis, elbow method, gap statistic
- **Visualization**: ggplot2 for cluster analysis and parallel coordinate plots

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Walmart Store Sales Forecasting (Kaggle Competition)
- **Records**: 421,570 sales observations across 81 departments
- **Variables**: 15 columns across sales, store, and economic data
- **Time Period**: 2010-2012 historical weekly sales data
- **Scope**: 45 stores across multiple locations

## Methodology
1. **Data Aggregation**: Calculate department-level metrics (average sales, holiday ratio, volatility)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create holiday sales ratio and coefficient of variation
3. **Optimal Cluster Selection**: Use silhouette analysis, elbow method, and gap statistic
4. **K-Means Implementation**: Apply clustering with standardized features
5. **Cluster Validation**: Bootstrap resampling and stability analysis
6. **Business Interpretation**: Translate clusters into actionable strategies

## Model Performance
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.64 (indicating good cluster separation)
- **Cluster Stability**: >0.75 Jaccard similarity across bootstrap samples
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: 0.68 (lower values indicate better separation)
- **Between/Within Cluster Variance Ratio**: 3.7

## Business Impact
- **Strategic Segmentation**: Clear identification of department behavioral patterns
- **Resource Optimization**: Targeted allocation based on cluster characteristics  
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Within-cluster comparison for improvement opportunities
- **Inventory Management**: Cluster-specific stocking and promotional strategies

## Key Insights
- **Holiday Sensitivity**: Primary differentiating factor between clusters
- **Sales Volatility**: Secondary factor creating distinct operational requirements
- **Natural Groupings**: Clusters transcend traditional category boundaries
- **Strategic Alignment**: Each cluster requires different management approaches
